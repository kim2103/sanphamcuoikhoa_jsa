          What are the different types of luggage tags and what do we signify?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Baggage Tags: These are small numbered or encoded tags attached to
            baggage by the baggage handler or airline employee at the check-in
            counter. Each tag is unique to the bag and contains information such
            as the bag's destination, owner's name and contact information, and
            any special handling instructions. The baggage tag is scanned by an
            automated system to track the bags' movements through the airport
            and onto the aircraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electronic Tags: These tags use radio frequency identification
            (RFID) technology to track and identify a bag's location. Unlike
            traditional baggage tags, RFID tags allow airport personnel to scan
            and track a bag's movements without the need for physical contact,
            making it easier and faster to locate lost or misrouted bags.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-Adhesive Tags: Some airlines allow passengers to print out
            their own baggage tags at home or at the airport kiosk. These tags
            can be attached to the luggage handle or elsewhere on the bag for
            easy identification.

          Can you suggest a luggage size for a weekend trip?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            For a weekend trip, a small or medium-sized luggage is usually
            enough. A carry-on suitcase or a duffel bag with a capacity of 20-30
            liters would be perfect. This size should hold all of your clothes,
            toiletries, and other essentials for a weekend trip. However, it's
            always a good idea to check with your airline's baggage policy to
            make sure your luggage meets their size and weight requirements.
